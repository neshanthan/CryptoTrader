CryptoTrader App

Boiler Plate from https://github.com/barbar/vortigern used

Use VSCode when editing as it will be easier

Git clone, and then run 'npm install' to install all the required files
'npm start' to run the dev server

I am using https://material-ui-next.com for the frontend framework, as it will be easier add all the components necessary instead of manually making each one and making it fit the theme.

E.g https://material-ui-next.com/demos/app-bar/ one of the components available

CoinMarket API implemented on homepage, minor theme bug where its not proper until refresh, will look at why tomorrow
