CryptoTrader App

Boiler Plate from https://github.com/barbar/vortigern used

Use VSCode when editing as it will be easier

Git clone, and then run 'npm install' to install all the required files
'npm start' to run the dev server

I am using https://material-ui-next.com for the frontend framework, as it will be easier add all the components necessary instead of manually making each one and making it fit the theme.

E.g https://material-ui-next.com/demos/app-bar/ one of the components available

The test login details are:

username: test
password: test123


CoinMarket API implemented on homepage

Cryptocurrency icons from https://github.com/cjdowner/cryptocurrency-icons used

Use Chrome Developer tools, too see how layout will look (Right click, inspect element, pick responsive and adjust to your screen size)
